# Machine-Learning-in-Julia
Yet, implementation of common machine learning algorithms in Julia. This repository is for totaly educational purposes in terms of both 
machine learning and Julia programming language.

Currently I am also new to Julia, and therefore have some performance problems that I aim to solve progressivelly. If you are a good at programming especially in julia, PRs are more than welcome.

## Algorithms
I am planning to implement as many algorithms as I can.Furthermore, I try to make code self explanatory so for further refer to code itself.
Here is the list that is active and working fine: 

* Perceptron learning algorithm based on the [Hinton](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)'s explanation in the course
* Feed forward neural networks for learning word embedding weights based on [Hinton](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)'s course

## For whom is this repo?
If you are: 
 - Trying to learn machine learning algorithms from scratch 
 - Taking some online courses but you have lack of experience in programming

If you are curious about state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning, Recursive Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Nets etc. There are 
a bunch of courses that should be taken to improve your experience. Assuming that you have some experiences in programming and basic probability
theory, here is the list of the courses that I learned a lot: 

1. [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)'s course is a good start point
2. [Hinton](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001) has a very comprehensive course to learn from basic neural networks to deep learning
3. [Udacity's deep learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) is a good way to look through the practice implementations of new techniques

I also would like to point out some blog posts that I found very useful while trying to learn machine learning by myself: 
- If you are just curious about anything but extremely new in the field, I strongly recommend to read this [post](https://darshanhegde.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/learn-machine-learning-the-hard-way/)
- This [post](http://www.denizyuret.com/2014/11/some-starting-points-for-deep-learning.html) and [that](http://www.denizyuret.com/2014/05/how-to-learn-about-deep-learning.html) is a reference point whenever you want to go deeper or
need extra resource.

## Help
Right now I am suffering from performance of the code beacuse of my lack of knowledge in julia. If you are good at Julia programming and like to teach someone, who is passionate about learning and implementing the code in a better way, this place may be a good fit for you.
